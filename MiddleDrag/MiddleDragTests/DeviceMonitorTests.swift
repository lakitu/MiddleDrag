/// Tests for DeviceMonitor
///
/// ## Coverage Expectations
///
/// This file has inherently low test coverage (~20%) because it interfaces with
/// Apple's private MultitouchSupport framework, which requires physical trackpad hardware.
///
/// **Lines that cannot be covered in CI (headless environment):**
/// - C callback function (`deviceContactCallback`) - only invoked by framework with real hardware
/// - Device enumeration loop - requires `MTDeviceCreateList()` to return actual devices
/// - Successful `start()` path - requires hardware to be detected
/// - Most of `stop()` - requires `start()` to succeed first (sets `isRunning = true`)
///
/// **What IS tested:**
/// - `init()` and `deinit` lifecycle with global state management
/// - Lock acquisition/release patterns
/// - Error handling when no device is found
/// - Crash-safety during rapid restart cycles
/// - Delegate assignment and weak reference behavior
///
/// The critical race condition fix (gCallbackEnabled flag + os_unfair_lock) is validated
/// by crash-safety tests that would fail if the synchronization was broken.
